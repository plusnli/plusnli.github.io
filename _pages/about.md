<!-- a first-year Ph.D. student at the University of Georgia. -->
Hi there👋I am Jiaxi Li, a PhD student at the University of Georgia. I obtained my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from Shandong University in June 2024.

My research interests lie in Large Language Models (LLMs) and particularly in LLM reasoning.
For their applications, I have experience in applying LLMs to the domains of healthcare and law with RAG (Retrieval-augmented Generation). I also worked on Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) before.

Currently I'm working on the following projects:
- LLM Reasoning: I am working on searching algorithms and post-training for LLM system-2 reasoning.
- Healthcare: To evaluate how knowledgeable of LLMs in healthcare and medical problems.

Graph-LLM-Reasoner (Intern in [TMLR Group](https://bhanml.github.io/))

[**Description**]
<strong><span class='show_paper_citations' data='DhtAFkwAAAAJ:ALROH1vI_8AC'></span></strong>
- We construct an interesting reasoning benchmark based on theft scenarios which tests the limitation of LLMs’ logical reasoning abilities.
- We build graph-llm-reasoner, a framework for LLM to solve complex reasoning problems.
- We extract rations from the problem and generate its graph representation, on which LLMs can probe and reason for the problem.
