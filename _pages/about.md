Hi there👋I am Jiaxi Li, a first-year Ph.D. student at the University of Georgia. I obtained my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from Shandong University in June 2024.

My research interests lie in Large Language Models (LLMs) and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and particularly in LLM reasoning.
For their applications, I have experience in applying LLMs and RAG to the doamins of healthcare and law. I also worked on Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) before.

Currently I'm working on the following projects:
- LLM Reasoning: I am working on LLM post-training and system-2 reasoning, with the ultimate goal of chasing the abilities of OpenAI o1.
- Healthcare: To evaluate how knowledgable of LLMs in healthcare and medical problems.
